Django 1.2 has been released
============================

I have been waiting for this release for a while now, mostly because it
includes some of the features I have been dying to get my hands on. The
ones I like the most are

-   support for multiple databases
-   smart-if template tag
-   The new Email Backends
-   relaxed requirements for usernames.

Here is a list for some of the features, and a little bit about each
one.

Support for multiple databases
------------------------------

> Django 1.2 adds the ability to use more than one database in your
> Django project. Queries can be issued at a specific database with the
> using() method on QuerySet objects. Individual objects can be saved to
> a specific database by providing a using argument when you call
> save().

Model validation
----------------

> Model instances now have support for validating their own data, and
> both model and form fields now accept configurable lists of validators
> specifying reusable, encapsulated validation behavior. Note, however,
> that validation must still be performed explicitly. Simply invoking a
> model instance’s save() method will not perform any validation of the
> instance’s data.

Improved CSRF protection
------------------------

> Django now has much improved protection against Cross-Site Request
> Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This type of attack occurs when a malicious
> Web site contains a link, a form button or some JavaScript that is
> intended to perform some action on your Web site, using the
> credentials of a logged-in user who visits the malicious site in their
> browser. A related type of attack, “login CSRF,” where an attacking
> site tricks a user’s browser into logging into a site with someone
> else’s credentials, is also covered.

Messages framework
------------------

> Django now includes a robust and configurable messages framework with
> built-in support for cookie- and session-based messaging, for both
> anonymous and authenticated clients. The messages framework replaces
> the deprecated user message API and allows you to temporarily store
> messages in one request and retrieve them for display in a subsequent
> request (usually the next one).

Object-level permissions
------------------------

> A foundation for specifying permissions at the per-object level has
> been added. Although there is no implementation of this in core, a
> custom authentication backend can provide this implementation and it
> will be used by django.contrib.auth.models.User. See the
> authentication docs for more information.

Permissions for anonymous users
-------------------------------

> If you provide a custom auth backend with supports\_anonymous\_user
> set to True, AnonymousUser will check the backend for permissions,
> just like User already did. This is useful for centralizing permission
> handling - apps can always delegate the question of whether something
> is allowed or not to the authorization/authentication backend. See the
> authentication docs for more details.

Relaxed requirements for usernames
----------------------------------

> The built-in User model’s username field now allows a wider range of
> characters, including @, +, . and - characters.

E-mail backends
---------------

> You can now configure the way that Django sends e-mail. Instead of
> using SMTP to send all e-mail, you can now choose a configurable
> e-mail backend to send messages. If your hosting provider uses a
> sandbox or some other non-SMTP technique for sending mail, you can now
> construct an e-mail backend that will allow Django’s standard mail
> sending methods to use those facilities. This also makes it easier to
> debug mail sending. Django ships with backend implementations that
> allow you to send e-mail to a file, to the console, or to memory. You
> can even configure all e-mail to be thrown away.

“Smart” if tag
--------------

> The if tag has been upgraded to be much more powerful. First, we’ve
> added support for comparison operators. The operators supported are
> ==, !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, in and not in, all of which work
> like the Python operators, in addition to and, or and not, which were
> already supported.

Template caching
----------------

> In previous versions of Django, every time you rendered a template, it
> would be reloaded from disk. In Django 1.2, you can use a cached
> template loader to load templates once, then cache the result for
> every subsequent render. This can lead to a significant performance
> improvement if your templates are broken into lots of smaller
> subtemplates (using the {% extends %} or {% include %} tags). As a
> side effect, it is now much easier to support non-Django template
> languages. For more details, see the notes on supporting non-Django
> template languages.

Natural keys in fixtures
------------------------

> Fixtures can now refer to remote objects using Natural keys. This
> lookup scheme is an alternative to the normal primary-key based object
> references in a fixture, improving readability and resolving problems
> referring to objects whose primary key value may not be predictable or
> known.

Fast failure for tests
----------------------

> Both the test subcommand of django-admin.py and the runtests.py script
> used to run Django's own test suite now support a --failfast option.
> When specified, this option causes the test runner to exit after
> encountering a failure instead of continuing with the test run. In
> addition, the handling of Ctrl-C during a test run has been improved
> to trigger a graceful exit from the test run that reports details of
> the tests that were run before the interruption.

BigIntegerField
---------------

> Models can now use a 64-bit BigIntegerField type.

Improved localization
---------------------

> Django's internationalization framework has been expanded with
> locale-aware formatting and form processing. That means, if enabled,
> dates and numbers on templates will be displayed using the format
> specified for the current locale. Django will also use localized
> formats when parsing data in forms. See Format localization for more
> details.

readonly\_fields in ModelAdmin
------------------------------

> django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.readonly\_fields has been added to
> enable non-editable fields in add/change pages for models and inlines.
> Field and calculated values can be displayed alongside editable
> fields.

And much much more!!
