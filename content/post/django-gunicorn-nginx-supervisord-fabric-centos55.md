+++

When I first started working with django I deployed my apps using apache
and mod\_python. Then after a little while I started playing with nginx
and switched my setup so that nginx was serving the static content and
reverse proxied requests back to apache and mod\_python. Not too long
after that, I switched out mod\_python with mod\_wsgi and ran mod\_wsgi
in daemon mode.

This setup worked well for a while, but one thing I never really liked
was the fact that I needed to run apache which is pretty heavy even when
you strip out all the unused modules. Apache is great, but all I was
really using it for was a router between nginx and mod\_wsgi, I wasn't
using any of the other features in apache.

I looked at fastcgi and uswgi and they looked good, but for one reason
or another I never made the jump. Recently I have been hearing a lot of
good things about green unicorn, so I decided to check it out. When I
first looked at it, it was fairly new and because of this a little
concerned with stability, so I kept and eye on it and watched it mature.

While I was waiting for green unicorn to mature I ended up doing a lot
of research on the [new python hosting
services](http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/06/django-hosting-roundup-who-wins/)
that recently hit the market. Three out of the five services that I
looked were using green unicorn, the other two were using uWSGI.

The fact that these three services are basing there new businesses on
green unicorn gave it a lot of credibility. Not too long after that I
started playing with green unicorn to see what it would take to get my
sites up and running.

The first thing that I noticed was that I didn't need to create a wsgi
file if I used their gunicorn\_django command, which was pretty sweet.
The fact that they built it into the service shows you that django is a
first class citizen.

The second thing that I noticed was that I needed a way to start up
green unicorn and keep it running, something that apache does for you
with mod\_wsgi. I did a little bit of research and found out that
supervisord would work perfectly for what I needed to do with green
unicorn.

Because seeing is better then reading, I'll guide you throw the steps
that you will need to do in order to get your system setup in a way that
will make using green unicorn very easy, especially if you want to run
more then one website on your server. I'm going to use a 256MB rackspace
cloud instance running centos 5.5.

Create a rackspace cloud server
===============================

Go into the rackspace cloud server management website and allocate
yourself a new 256MB CentOS 5.5 server or if you prefer do the same
thing using their API. Now that you have a server and the root password,
follow along step by step to get you system all setup.

Software and versions
=====================

-   RackSpace Cloud Server 256MB
-   CentOS 5.5
-   Python 2.6.6
-   nginx 1.0.4
-   supervisord 3.0a10
-   virtualenv 1.6.1
-   pip 1.0.1
-   gunicorn 0.12.2
-   fabric 1.1.0

Bitbucket project
=================

To make things easier I have created a django bootstrap project
directory with all of the file used in the blog post. It is located
here, so feel free to clone and fork.

<https://bitbucket.org/kencochrane/django-gunicorn-nginx-supervisord-bootstrap/>

Login to server
===============

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
ssh root@<RackSpaceIP>
```

Update packages
===============

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
yum -y update
```

Install packages
================

You might not need all of these right now, but I normally need these
down the line, so doing them all now.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
yum -y install emacs readline-devel ncurses-devel libevent-devel glib2-devel libjpeg-devel freetype-devel bzip2 bzip2-devel bzip2-libs openssl-devel pcre pcre-devel gpg make gcc yum-utils unzip
```

Add a django user as a system user
==================================

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
useradd -d /opt/django -m -r django
```

Set password for django to what ever you want
=============================================

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
passwd django
```

Setup directories
=================

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
mkdir -p /opt/django
mkdir -p /opt/django/apps
mkdir -p /opt/django/logs
mkdir -p /opt/django/logs/nginx
mkdir -p /opt/django/logs/apps
mkdir -p /opt/django/configs
mkdir -p /opt/django/scripts
mkdir -p /opt/django/htdocs
mkdir -p /opt/django/tmp
mkdir -p /opt/django/configs/nginx
mkdir -p /opt/django/configs/supervisord
mkdir -p /opt/django/apps/my_app
```

Add blank html page
===================

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
echo "<html><body>nothing here</body></html> " > /opt/django/htdocs/index.html
```

Install Zlib
============

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
# download from zlib.net
mkdir -p /tmp/downloads
cd /tmp/downloads
wget http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz
tar -xvzf zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz
cd zlib-1.2.5
./configure -s
make install
```

Install python 2.6.6
====================

CentOS 5.5 doesn't come with python2.6 pre installed so we need to do
that on our own.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
mkdir -p /tmp/downloads
cd /tmp/downloads
wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.6/Python-2.6.6.tgz
tar -xvzf Python-2.6.6.tgz
cd Python-2.6.6
./configure --enable-shared
make
make altinstall
```

Add the following to /etc/profile
=================================

We need to add the lib path to the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH or else you will
get an error saying it can't find libpython2.6.so.1.0

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/:/usr/local/lib64/
```

Source the new profile
======================

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
source /etc/profile
```

Install distribute
==================

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
mkdir -p /tmp/downloads
cd /tmp/downloads
curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
python2.6 distribute_setup.py
```

Install Pip & virtualenv
========================

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
mkdir -p /tmp/downloads
cd /tmp/downloads
curl -O -k https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
python2.6 get-pip.py
pip install virtualenv
```

Install supervisor
==================

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
pip install supervisor
```

Install mercurial
=================

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
pip install mercurial
```

Install NGINX
=============

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
mkdir -p /tmp/downloads
cd /tmp/downloads
wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.0.4.tar.gz
tar -xzvf nginx-1.0.4.tar.gz
cd nginx-1.0.4
./configure --sbin-path=/usr/local/sbin --with-http_ssl_module --with-http_stub_status_module
make
/etc/init.d/nginx stop
sleep 2
sudo make install
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/nginx
```

Install my app
--------------

Add first virtualenv
====================

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
cd /opt/django/apps/my_app/
virtualenv --distribute --no-site-packages v0.1

# make this a post_create hook?
touch /opt/django/apps/my_app/v0.1/.venv

cd /opt/django/apps/my_app/v0.1/
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/kencochrane/django-gunicorn-nginx-supervisord-bootstrap my_app

ln -s /opt/django/apps/my_app/v0.1 /opt/django/apps/my_app/current

ln -s /opt/django/apps/my_app/current/my_app/conf/nginx.conf /opt/django/configs/nginx/myapp.conf

ln -s /opt/django/apps/my_app/current/my_app/conf/supervisord.conf /opt/django/configs/supervisord/myapp.conf

# activate the ve
source /opt/django/apps/my_app/current/bin/activate
cd /opt/django/apps/my_app/current/my_app/
./bootstrap.py
```

Configure nginx
===============

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
# as root
mkdir -p /etc/nginx
ln -s /opt/django/apps/my_app/current/my_app/server/etc/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
ln -s /usr/local/nginx/conf/mime.types /etc/nginx/mime.types
ln -s /opt/django/apps/my_app/current/my_app/server/init.d/nginx /etc/init.d/nginx
chmod 755 /etc/init.d/nginx
chkconfig --add nginx
chkconfig nginx on
```

Configure Supervisord
=====================

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
# as root
ln -s /opt/django/apps/my_app/current/my_app/server/etc/supervisord.conf  /etc/supervisord.conf
ln -s /opt/django/apps/my_app/current/my_app/server/init.d/supervisord /etc/init.d/supervisord
chmod 755 /etc/init.d/supervisord
chkconfig --add supervisord
chkconfig supervisord on
```

Firewall
========

We need to open up the firewall so that we are allowed connection, if
you don't know anything about this, check out these links.

<http://cloudservers.rackspacecloud.com/index.php/Firewalls>
<http://cloudservers.rackspacecloud.com/index.php/Introduction_to_iptables>
<http://cloudservers.rackspacecloud.com/index.php/Sample_iptables_ruleset>

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
# Open http port 80
iptables -I RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
```

.bashrc file changes
====================

I can't remember where I saw this little trick, if you know please let
me know so that I can give them credit. If you put a file in your
mercurial directory called .venv, when you cd into the directory this
little bash hack will automatically activate your virtual environment
for you. This allows you to have something similar to virtualenvwrapper
in this custom setup.

Add this code to the .bashrc file

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
emacs /opt/django/.bashrc
#
# User specific aliases and functions
has_virtualenv() {
    if [ -e .venv ]; then
        deactivate >/dev/null 2>&1
        source bin/activate
    fi
}

venv_cd () {
    cd "$@" && has_virtualenv
}

alias cd="venv_cd"

#end of changes

# source the file to get new changes in active shell
source /opt/django/.bashrc
```

Change permissions of the django home directory to django
=========================================================

This cleans up and left over root ownership

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
chown -R django:django /opt/django/*
```

Switch to django user
=====================

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
su - django
```

Start up nginx
==============

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
service nginx start
```

Startup supervisord
===================

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
service supervisord start
```

Test Nginx and supervisord
==========================

Check supervisord status

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
supervisorctl status
my_app                           RUNNING    pid 13594, uptime 0:00:05
```

To check nginx go to the IP or domain name for your rackspace server in
your browser and make sure it worked.

Updating the application using fabric
=====================================

Inside of the bitbucket project directory there is a file called
fabfile.py. This file will allow you to update the application from your
machine whenever you want just by calling one command.

It will prompt you for your hostname and password for the django user.
Then it will go out to the rackspace server and pull and update the app
and restart the application in supervisord. It is very basic for right
now, but should get you started if you want to do more advanced stuff.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
fab update_server
```

Conclusion
==========

Now that we have everything setup, if you want to add a new application
to our setup all we need to do is.

-   create a new directory under apps
-   create the virtualenv
-   run the bootstrap to install the software
-   make sure that the application has a supervisord and nginx
    configuration file
-   symlink those files to the correct locations in the config directory
-   run any python management commands you might need to run (syncdb,
    migrate, etc)
-   reload supervisord and nginx
-   you should be good to go.

I hope this was helpful to someone besides myself, if it was helpful for
you please let me know in the comments.
