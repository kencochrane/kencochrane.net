I work for a company called [CashStar](http://CashStar.com), most people
have never heard of us, but a lot of people have used our products
without even knowing it. CashStar is the man behind the curtain so to
speak. We created an e-gift card platform that is used by some of the
largest companies in the United States. Here is a short list of some of
our customers: The Home Depot, Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Staples,
Coach, Starbucks, CVS, Chilis, Regal Cinemas, Pottery Barn, The
CheeseCake Factory, Dell, Pizza Hut, and many more. To see the full list
follow this link: <http://www.cashstar.com/all-egift-card-clients/>

Another thing that most people don't know is that we power that platform
using the awesome python framework called
[Django](http://DjangoProject.com). Using Python and Django, our small
engineering team in Portland, Maine has taken our startup which didn't
exist 3 years ago and turned it into a leader in the electronic gift
card market. Due to this phenomenal growth, we need to expand our
engineering team. We are currently looking for developers as well as QA
folks to join our team. You will need to work on site in Portland Maine,
and be legally allowed to work in the United States.

If you are interested in joining a fun, fast paced startup, please send
the following to <kencochrane@gmail.com> with the subject line
