The other day I wrote about a new [Django hosting service called
ep.io](http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/04/my-experiences-with-epio/) ,
after I made that post, I was lucky enough to get an invite for the
private beta of [gondor.io](http://gondor.io), which is similar to
[ep.io](http://ep.io) but from the folks over at
[Eldarion](http://eldarion.com/). In order to test out the service I
decided to take my Dango blog application and deploy it to Gondor and I
kept notes along the way, here are those notes.

The sign up process was pretty typical, register and then validate your
email address. Once into the system you are offered the ability to
create a site. So I created my site "KenCochrane\_blog" and it gave me a
key which I'll use later on. Not knowing where to start I headed over to
the [documentation](https://gondor.io/support/). Which, as of this
writing, is pretty basic, which is understandable since they are still
in beta. I'm assuming the documentation will get better as they move
forward. The current documentation and this blog post should get you
enough information to get going.

Setting up my development environment:
======================================

Gondor uses a file to store your login credentials, so that you don't
need to type it in everytime. It is pretty basic, here is how I
installed mine on my MacBook Pro (OSX 10.6).

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
# create the file, and edit it.
$ emacs ~/.gondor

# copy this into the file.

[auth]
username = <my_username>
password = <my_password>

# change the permissions so that only you can access it.
$ chmod 600 ~/.gondor
```

Like all cool projects these days, gondor uses pip and virtualenv, I'm
assuming you already have virtualenv and pip installed so I'll move onto
the fun stuff.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
# make my virtualenv called gondor
$ mkvirtualenv gondor
```

From this point on, all of these commands are done in the new gondor
virtual environment that I just created. Gondor uses a command line
client to manage your application, we need to install that before we can
do anything.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ pip install gondor
```

Since I'm going to need to make changes to my blog, I decided to fork it
and make all of my changes to gondor on the new fork. The new fork is on
bitbucket and it is called kencochranenet\_gondor. Now that I have it
forked I can pull it down locally.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
# go to my projects directory and clone my blog.
$ cd ~/projects
$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/kencochrane/kencochranenet_gondor kencochranenet_gondor
$ cd kencochranenet_gondor/mysite
```

Now that we have some code to deploy, lets introduce the code to gondor.
We use the init command inside of our django project and it will create
a .gondor directory with a config file and some defaults.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ gondor init <site_key>
```

Gondor expects your project to be in a certain layout in order to work.
For more info see the documentation:
<https://gondor.io/support/project-layout/>

Since my blog didn't have everything in the right place, I need to add
some directories and move some files around. One of the files I needed
to add was deploy/wsgi.py, here is what it contains. Notice the two
sys.path.insert lines. I added those because the [gondor
documentation](https://gondor.io/support/setting-up-django/) told me
too.

``` {.sourceCode .python}
import os, sys

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), os.pardir, os.pardir)))
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), os.pardir)))

from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler
os.environ["DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE"] = "mysite.settings"
application = WSGIHandler()
```

I also had to add the same sys.path lines to my manage.py settings. Here
is my new manage.py

``` {.sourceCode .python}
#!/usr/bin/env python
from django.core.management import execute_manager
import sys
import os

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), os.pardir, os.pardir)))
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), os.pardir)))

try:
    import settings # Assumed to be in the same directory.
except ImportError:
    sys.stderr.write("Error: Can't find the file 'settings.py' in the directory containing %r. It appears you've customized things.\nYou'll have to run django-admin.py, passing it your settings module.\n(If the file settings.py does indeed exist, it's causing an ImportError somehow.)\n" % __file__)
    sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    execute_manager(settings)
```

Gondor will automagically add your database and other settings to your
app for you at deployment, and in order for that to work correctly you
need to add the following at the end of your settings.py file.

``` {.sourceCode .python}
try:
    from local_settings import *
except ImportError:
    pass
```

My blog is using south to manage south migrations, so we need to edit
the .gondor/config file to enable this.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
# edit .gondor/config changed migrations to migrations=south
emacs .gondor/config

# change this line
migrations = None
# to
migrations = south
```

Now that we have made all of the changes that we need. I need to commit
all of my changes. It is important to note that because gondor uses
mecurial or git for managing your project files, you need to always
remember to add new files and commit all changes before you try to
deploy your application.

Deployment:
-----------

Next step is deployment. Before we get there, we need to create a new
instance. Gondor allows you to deploy multiple versions of your code,
this lets you have a production version and development versions all
running at the same time. Gondor calls these different deployments
'instances'. We run the 'gondor create master' command, which will
create a new instance called, you guessed it, 'master', and this is what
you should see.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ gondor create master
Reading configuration... [ok]
Creating instance on Gondor... [ok]   

Run: gondor deploy master HEAD
Visit: http://jg437.o1.gondor.io/
```

This created the master instance and tells us what our url for the
instance will be. Now according to the log message I just need to run
'gondor deploy master HEAD' and that will deploy my app. Lets do that
now.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ gondor deploy master HEAD
  Reading configuration... [ok]
  ERROR: could not map 'HEAD' to a SHA
```

As you can see, it didn't work, after lots of digging, I realized that
the code was assuming I was on a branch called HEAD, which wasn't
correct. I think HEAD is the default git branch, and in mercirual, it is
default. Just to be sure, I checked my mercurial branch.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ hg summary

parent: 122:76f0c2271b7f tip
 gondor settings
branch: default
commit: (clean)

update: (current)
```

Running the quick 'hg summary' command lets me know that my branch is
default, so I then made the changes to my command and reran the script.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ gondor deploy master default

Reading configuration... [ok]
Building tarball from default... [ok]
Pushing tarball to Gondor...
Deploying... [failed]

pip has failed installing your requirements. Here is the output we saw:

```

We had mysql-python in our requirements file, and gondor doesn't support
mysql, so we need to remove that, commit and try again.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ gondor deploy master default

Reading configuration... [ok]
Building tarball from default... [ok]
Pushing tarball to Gondor...
Deploying... [failed]

unable to build static (collectstatic or build_static not found)
```

closer but no cigar, gondor uses staticfiles (new in django 1.3 or
django-staticfiles) to manage static files. If you aren't currently
using static files add django-staticfiles to your pre django 1.3 app, or
upgrade to django 1.3 and configure static files. To be honest, this was
the biggest problem I had, it took me a while to get this correct. I was
lucky enough to get some help on the \#gondor IRC channel, which helped
me along the way. With all of my changes made I committed them and tried
again.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ gondor deploy master default
Reading configuration... [ok]
Building tarball from default... [ok]
Pushing tarball to Gondor...
Deploying... [ok]
```

That worked!! woo hoo! now if I go to the URL
(<http://jg437.o1.gondor.io/>) I got earlier, I should see something if
all went well. I went to the site, and bingo, all working.. no data but
it is there. Now how do I create my django admin user? Normally that is
done when you do your initial syncdb, and since that is done by gondor,
it doesn't give you a chance. Looking thru all of the documentation I
didn't find anything. So I went and looked at the gondor client source
code, and I found my answer. I kicked off the following command,
answered the prompts and bingo, I was in business.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ gondor run master createsuperuser
```

Conclusion
----------

Now that I have my app up and running and I have admin access I could
switch over my blog to the new service if I wanted. I'll hold off for
right now, but you get the picture. All and all I think this is going to
be a nice service once they are fully up and running. It isn't as far
along as ep.io, but I'm sure it won't be long before they are caught up.
I'll try and keep this post updated as I learn more about the service
and they release new features.

### Update:

Read how this service stacks up against other services like it in my
[Django hosting
roundup](http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/06/django-hosting-roundup-who-wins/)

2/16/2012: Full disclosure. On Feb 16th 2012, I accepted a job with
dotCloud a competitor to gondor.io. I plan on keeping this blog post up
to date and impartial. If you think there are any errors, please let me
know in the comments.
