Intro
=====

For the past 6 weeks I have been trying out all of the new django/python
hosting services that are currently available today, and I have been
writing about my experiences along the way. It only makes sense to
conclude this series of articles with one last article comparing all of
the services against each other. It is important to note that many of
these services are still in development and aren't even available to the
general public, so I'll try to keep this article up to date as these
services change over time. With that said, don't take my word for it, go
out and try all of these services on your own and find out which one you
like the best, you won't be disappointed.

Quick Recap
===========

ep.io
-----

Blog post: [My Experiences with
ep.io](http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/04/my-experiences-with-epio/)

Pretty solid offering, with a nice set of features and a decent price.
Good set of documentation.

\[**Update**: Epio closed down on May 31st 2012 \]

gondor.io
---------

Blog post: [My day in
gondor.io](http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/04/my-day-gondorio/)

Their website has a nice list of features that they expect to have once
they officially launch, but most of those features aren't available yet.
The documentation is a little light, but the service has a lot of
potential.

dotCloud.com
------------

Blog post: [Deploying my Django application to
dotcloud.com](http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/04/deploying-my-django-application-to-dotcloud/)

They have a ton of money ($10M), and with it, a ton of features. They
are very developer friendly, but you need to be pretty technical, it
isn't quite ready for beginners. Good set of documentation.

\[**Full disclosure**: I now work for dotCloud\]

AppHosted.com
-------------

Blog post: [apphosted.com Django Hosting
Review](http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/05/apphosted-com-django-hosting-review/)

Built with security, stability and scalability on their mind from the
beginning. They have a solid offering, and they look to be targeting
enterprise customers who will pay more for that peace of mind. They are
currently lacking some key features, which I'm sure they will be adding
soon. Good set of documentation.

DjangoZoom.com
--------------

Blog post: [DjangoZoom.com
Review](http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/06/djangozoom-com-review/)

Built to be fast and easy to use, still missing some key features, but
I'm sure they will be available by the time they go live. Decent amount
of documentation.

Heroku.com
----------

Blog post: [Developers guide for running django apps on
Heroku](http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/11/developers-guide-for-running-django-apps-on-heroku/)

Originally built as a Ruby on Rails service, they have now added support
for python. The service is still in beta, but it has a lot of potential.
It looks a lot like what dotCloud is offering, with the ability to run
code from almost any language, and a ton of different add-ons for lots
of different services.

Awards
======

Fastest Deployments:
--------------------

[DjangoZoom.com](http://DjangoZoom.com) - Zoom is right, it doesn't take
long to configure your application and have it up and running on their
servers.

Easiest To Use:
---------------

[DjangoZoom.com](http://DjangoZoom.com) - No command line interface
needed, just a web browser, a project in a git repo that it has access
too, and a few questions answered and your app is up and running.

Most Features:
--------------

[dotCloud.com](http://dotcloud.com) - They raised \$10 Million, and they
are spending it on hiring people, buying companies, and building
services. They have a bunch of services currently and they don't plan on
stopping, their roadmap has everything on it, and I think if you give
them enough time they will eventually have a service for everything.

Most Developer Friendly:
------------------------

[dotCloud.com](http://dotcloud.com) - They give lots of features without
handcuffing the developer. They are the only company with full database
and shell access. They do a good job of offering the same type of
service a developer could get if they built it themselves.

Best Overall Value:
-------------------

[ep.io](http://ep.io) - This one is hard since most of the services
don't have any pricing listed, but currently ep.io is in the lead, they
offer reasonable prices with a nice Free tier. This allows developers to
try out the service for FREE, as well as run smaller pet projects that
they might not have tried before because they didn't want to pay for
hosting. They have the second most features available, second to only
dotCloud, and there service is pretty solid.

Easiest Project Setup:
----------------------

[apphosted.com](http://apphosted.com) - Their goal was to make it real
easy to get your project up onto their servers without having to change
your project, and they did that, there was very little if any changes I
needed to make in order to get my application up on their servers.

Django Feature Hosting Matrix
=============================

To make things easier when comparing all of the different services I
have built this matrix with all of the information I compiled from each
of the services. I don't know the answers for all services, but I'll
update it when I find out those answers. If you know the answers feel
free to post a comment to let me know.

I have included all of the new django services as well as google app
engine and webfaction.com, a tradition hosting service. This should make
it a little easier to see how these new services compare to other
hosting options.

**[Chart removed since it was out of date]**

Who wins?
=========

It is really hard to pick just one winner, mainly because most of these
services are still in beta and not quite finished yet. Also because each
service is a little different, and it will depend on what you are trying
to do. So, go out try them out, and let me know which one you picked.

The real winner is us, the developers, and the python community in
general. We now have a bunch of really cool services that will make our
lives better, and that is awesome.

Thank you!
==========

I want to thank all of the people who made these services, and gave me
early access to their systems so that I could play around with them. I
wish them the best of luck, and hope they all are really successful, and
they are around for a long time.
