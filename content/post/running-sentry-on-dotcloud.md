[Sentry](https://github.com/dcramer/sentry) is a realtime event logging
and aggregation platform. At itâ€™s core it specializes in monitoring
errors and extracting all the information needed to do a proper
post-mortum without any of the hassle of the standard user feedback
loop.

The main feature of sentry and the ability to send all of your
application logs to one place, and then aggregate them, so that you only
get one error email for the same error. This will keep your mailbox from
flooding, when something goes wrong.

Putting your logging server on a different server or network then your
production servers is a good idea. If something goes wrong, and you
can't access your servers, you can still see what errors were getting
thrown before the servers started having problems.

Follow these easy steps to get sentry up and running on DotCloud.

1.  Create a place to store your project

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ mkdir -p ~/projects
```

2.  Go into the projects directory

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ cd ~/projects
```

3.  Clone git repo from github, requires git client

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ git clone git://github.com/kencochrane/sentry-on-dotcloud.git
```

4.  Go into the new project directory

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ cd sentry-on-dotcloud
```

5.  Creating the virtualenv (using virtualenvwrapper, virtualenv,
    and pip)

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute sentry-on-dotcloud
```

6.  Install all of the Sentry requirements via pip and the
    requirements.txt file.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

7.  Installing the dotCloud client
    <http://docs.dotcloud.com/firststeps/install/> (here are the steps
    for Linux and Mac OSX)

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ sudo pip install -U dotcloud
```

8.  Sign up for a dotcloud account
    <https://www.dotcloud.com/accounts/register/> if you
    haven't already.
9.  The first time you use the dotCloud account you will need to add
    your api key. So type dotcloud and follow the steps. You can find
    your API key at <http://www.dotcloud.com/account/settings>

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ dotcloud
```

10. Create your dotcloud application

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ dotcloud create sentry
```

11. Change the SENTRY\_KEY settings in these files, to the same
    unique value.
    -   sentry\_conf.py
    -   sentryproj/settings.py

Here is an example on how to generate a good unique key that you can use
in the files above.

``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> import base64
>>> import os
>>> KEY_LENGTH = 40
>>> base64.b64encode(os.urandom(KEY_LENGTH))
'6+tSEh1qYwDuTaaQRcxUjMDkvlj4z9BU/caCFV5QKtvnH7ZF3i0knA=='
```

12. Add your email address to SENTRY\_ADMINS in sentryproj/settings.py .
    This will send you emails when an error occurs.

``` {.sourceCode .python}
SENTRY_ADMINS = ('youremail@example.com',)
```

13. Push your code into dotcloud

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ dotcloud push sentry .
```

14. Find out your application url

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ dotcloud url sentry
```

15. Open url in your browser and start using sentry on dotcloud.
16. First things first you should change the admin password from the
    default one that was created on deployment. The default username and
    password are found in the mkadmin.py file.
17. Test out sentry using the raven client to make sure it is working as
    it should. Open up a python shell on your local machine and do
    the following.

Replace the server\_url with your sentry url you found out in step 14.
Make sure it ends in /store/ . Also make sure you replace my\_key with
your sentry key

``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> from raven import Client
>>> server_url = "http://sentry-username.dotcloud.com/store/"
>>> my_key='1234-CHANGEME-WITH-YOUR-OWN-KEY-567890'
>>> client = Client(servers=[server_url], key=my_key)
>>> client.create_from_text('My event just happened!')
('48ba88039e0f425399118f82173682dd', '3313fc5636650cccaee55dfc2f2ee7dd')
```

If you go to the sentry webpage you should see your test message. If
not, double check everything, and see if there was any errors during the
send.

Once this is all up and running you can install the raven client in your
applications, and start sending your logs to sentry.

18. Optional: If you don't like the URL they gave you, you can use your
    custom domain. Assuming your application was sentry.www and your
    domain was www.example.com you would do the following

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ dotcloud alias add sentry.www www.example.com
```

Once you get comfortable with how things work, don't forget to change
your DEBUG setting to False. Go ahead and fork my project and get
started today.
