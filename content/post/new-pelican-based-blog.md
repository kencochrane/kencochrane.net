I have recently changed my Django based blog to a statically generated
blog based on [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), and hosted by [GitHub
Pages](http://pages.github.com). This is for a couple of reasons.

The first reason was because my blog is really simple, it was just a
bunch of reStructuredText documents that were converted to HTML. I
didn't need the Django-admin features and I always felt it was a little
overkill for my blog.

The second reason was because I wanted to host my blog contents on
GitHub so that others could change/update/edit my blog posts and send me
pull requests if they have something good to add. Doing this with my old
blog would have been hard, but it will be really easy with this current
setup.

I was looking through all of the different static generators, and boy
there are a lot of them. I decided to pick pelican because it did what I
needed, and was real easy to setup and use.

My requirements for a site generator:

1.  Python: I wanted it python based, in case it needed any changes, I
    wouldn't need much of a learning curve learning a new language.
2.  Open Source: I wanted to have the ability to change it to add my own
    features in case it doesn't have them to start. Plus Open Source
    code rules.
3.  reStructureText: I wanted to write my blog posts in ReST.
4.  Themes: I wanted some out of the box themes that I could pick from
    and customize
5.  Easy: I wanted something with minimum setup and overhead to
    get started.
6.  Maintain Links: I wanted to keep the same URL structure from my old
    blog so I wouldn't get lots of 404 errors once I converted.
7.  Active development: I wanted a project that is currently under
    active development.

After I did some quick searches, I found Pelican, and I liked what I
saw. I wrote a simple python script that pull out my blog posts from my
old blog and generated the initial ReST docs, which got me most of the
way there.

Once I got the content pulled out, I just needed to pick a theme, and
configure the settings. Then setup my github pages site, and push all
the code. The last change was to change my DNS records, and then I was
done.

Now anytime I want to write a blog post, all I have to do is add a new
ReST doc and rerun the build command, and commit my changes, and push my
repo. Then github automatically updates my site. Simple as that.

I'll run it from github for a little while and see how I like it. I
might end up changing hosting, since github has very limited features,
and doesn't allow you to add any rewrite rules or anything custom. I
could have just as easily hosted on AWS s3, or
[dotCloud](http://dotCloud.com), but I wanted to try this out first
since it was pretty easy to setup.

If you switched to a static site generator, or are thinking about doing
it, let me know what you think and what tools you are using.
