It seems like everyone has their own
[PAAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) solution
these days, and if they don't have one yet, it is just a matter of time
before they will. Red Hat has recently joined in on the fun with their
[OpenShift](https://openshift.redhat.com) platform.

I decided to take it for a test drive, and share my results with you.
This service is still in beta and things are changing all of the time,
so these notes might not work in the future, take that into
consideration when using it as a guide.

There really isn't much python documentation for this platform, and what
documentation there is, is either a little out of date, or missing some
important steps. Hopefully this guide will help you get your application
up and running.

OpenShift is divided into two parts, Flex and Express.

[Flex](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/flex):
==============================================

> "Dedicated cloud solution. Get more control over your apps, or move
> your existing applications to the cloud with ease! Flex is a dedicated
> cloud solution that provides everything you need to easily scale,
> provision, deploy, and monitor your applications."

Flex runs on top of your amazon EC2 account, and currently only supports
Java and PHP. It is targeting the enterprise crowd and has more features
compared to Express.

[Express](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/express):
====================================================

> "Shared cloud solution. Express is a free, cloud-based application
> platform for Java, Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby applications. It's
> super-simpleâ€”your development environment is also your deployment
> environment: git push, and you're in the cloud!"

Express runs on Red Hat's servers, and currently supports Java, Ruby,
PHP, Perl and Python apps. It doesn't have the same features of Flex,
but if you don't need those advanced features, then express might be
fine for you. Since I'm interested in deploying python apps, and Express
is the only one that supports python apps, that is the one I'll show you
today.

To make things easier to show you how things work, I'll create a simple
django application and walk you through the steps to deploying it. I'm
going to deploy a djangoCMS to express that will connect to a mysql
database.

Steps:
------

### 1. Create an account

Create an account by filling out the form at
<http://openshift.redhat.com/> and don't forget your username and
password, you will need that later.

### 2. Install Perquisites:

> -   [git](http://git-scm.com/)
> -   [python](http://python.org)
> -   openshift client
>
> \*\*<Git:**>
>
> I'm not going to go over the steps to install git, for more info, you
> can get it from the git website. <http://git-scm.com/download>
>
> **Python:**
>
> If you are using a Mac or linux, it most likely already has python
> installed, if you are using windows, you you don't have python
> installed. Goto the python website and you will find instructions on
> how to install python on your system. <http://python.org/download/>
>
> **OpenShift client:**
>
> For instructions on how to Install the client go to this page.
> <https://openshift.redhat.com/app/express#mac> Here are my steps for
> Mac OSX

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ sudo gem install json_pure
$ sudo gem install rhc
```

### 3. Create a domain.

Now that you have everything installed, your first step is to create a
domain. Run the following command and replace \$mydoman and \$loginemail
with your own domain and the login email you used when creating an
account.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ rhc-create-domain -n $mydomain -l $loginemail
```

### 4. Create an application

Now that you have a domain, you need to create an application that you
can deploy to that domain. Running the following command will create a
new wsgi application called 'blog'. You can name your application
anything you want, within reason. We pick wsgi, because our python
application will be wsgi compatible.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ rhc-create-app -a blog -t wsgi-3.2
```

### 5. Add mysql to your app

We want to use mysql as our database backend for this blog, so we need
to add mysql to our application using the command below.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ rhc-ctl-app -a blog -e add-mysql-5.1
```

### 6. Add phpmyadmin to help you manage your database

OpenShift doesn't give you direct access to your database, so you will
need a way to manage your database a different way. They provide the
ability to add PHPMyAdmin to your app so that you can get to your data.
This step is optional, but recommended.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ rhc-ctl-app -a blog -e add-phpmyadmin-3.4
```

### 7. Add this upstream repo from github

When you create your application, it will create a directory with a
bunch of other files and directories in it. If you were starting from
scratch and building up your application you would start from here. To
make things easier I created a project on github that will allow you to
get up and running with DjangoCMS much faster. In order to use my
project you will need to run the following commands so that it will pull
down the code into your project.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ cd blog
$ git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/kencochrane/django-cms-openshift.git
$ git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
```

Once the code is downloaded, you can take a look at the code, change
anything you want and when you are ready you can deploy the app.

### 8. Deploying the app

To deploy all you need to do is push the repo upstream into open shift.
To this, you just need to run the following command.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ git push
```

When it pushes you application into open shift it will do the following.
(without jenkins add-on installed)

> 1.  stop app
> 2.  \*pre\_build
> 3.  \*build
> 4.  start\_dbs
> 5.  \*deploy
> 6.  start\_app
> 7.  \*post\_deploy

The steps marked with a \* are scripts that are located in
*.openshift/action\_hooks/&lt;script\_name&gt;* if you have something in
those files it will run them, and if not, it will pass right by. These
are very helpful if you want something to happen at points of the
deployment process. For example, in the deploy script you will notice
that I have some code to kick off the django syncdb, migrate, and
collect static commands. These will run every time I deploy the app.

I have also created a django management command that will check to see
if there is a django admin account created and if not, it will create
one and set the default password. I had to do this because there is
currently no way that I know of where you can kick off django management
commands after the deployment is finished. It will only create the admin
account once, and every other time it will just get ignored.

**IMPORTANT:** It is important to note that if you want to do anything
related to the database, you can't do it in the *pre\_build* or *build*
scripts, because the database isn't available yet. This one thing caused
me lots of pain, because I couldn't figure out by my migrations were not
working. If you do make the mistake of trying to do something database
related in the *build* script you will see an error like this.

> "remote: ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on
> 'xxx.x.xx.x' (111)"

That's it, you can now checkout your application at (default admin
account is admin/&lt;password given at deploy time&gt;):

> <http://blog-$yourdomain.rhcloud.com>

Once you visit the page you should see the djangoCMS default page. First
things first, login to the django admin, and change the password from
the default password to something secure. Then get started building your
own app.

Helpful tips:
-------------

### Viewing logs:

If you would like to view your logs to see what is going on with your
application you just need to run this command.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ rhc-tail-files -a blog
```

### Application information:

If you would like more information about your application you can run
this command.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ rhc-user-info
```

Also checkout the README file they add when you create an application,
it is pretty helpful, and might answer some common questions.

### Application dependencies:

OpenShift uses virtualenv but it doesn't use pip, it depends on the
dependencies be listed in the setup.py file. During the deploy process I
did notice that it installed pip, so it might be possible to add a
requirements.txt file, and then in your build action\_hook script call
pip install -r &lt;path&gt;/requirements.txt but I'm not sure if this is
supported, or if it will cause problems, so it might be best to stick
with what they have for now.

### Static media:

If you look in wsgi/static/.htaccess there a rewrite rule to get the
media to work correctly, you can use this trick for other apache tricks
if you want. For more information on this checkout the README file.

### What is it open shift running:

Red Hat linux with Apache / mod\_wsgi, and mysql 5.1

### What type of apps do they support?

Here is the current link which can be found if you run this commands and
look at the types.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ rhc-create-app -h

raw-0.1, php-5.3, jbossas-7.0, rack-1.1, jenkins-1.4, perl-5.10, wsgi-3.2
```

### What else does it support?

Things are changing all of the time, but if you run this command you
will get a list of the current supported addons.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ rhc-ctl-app -L

List of supported embedded cartridges:

Obtaining list of cartridges (please excuse the delay)...

    - metrics-0.1
    - mysql-5.1
    - jenkins-client-1.4
    - 10gen-mms-agent-0.1
    - phpmyadmin-3.4
    - rockmongo-1.1
    - mongodb-2.0
```

### Web based control panel:

They offer a web based control panel to do some of the things you can do
with the command line, which will be nice, but it doesn't work right
now. It doesn't display the correct information, and it doesn't even
show the applications I have created, so I don't trust it. Hopefully
these issues will get fixed in the future, and this tool will make it
easier for less technical people to get started.

### Conclusion:

It is nice to see another platform on the market, it is still pretty
rough, and there isn't much documentation, but I found it usable. I'm
sure once they stabilize things, they will spend more time on the
documentation side of things.

### Update

2/16/2012: Full disclosure. On Feb 16th 2012, I accepted a job with
dotCloud a competitor to openShift. I plan on keeping this blog post up
to date and impartial. If you think there are any errors, please let me
know in the comments.
