I would like to announce the release of a new project I have been working on. <a href="http://100boxes.com/">100Boxes.com FREE online Football Squares Pool</a> . I basically took the classic superbowl squares game, that is usually played with paper and spreadsheets and I put it online. I tried to make it as simple as possible for someone to manage their pool, and for people to buy their squares. I started the project pretty late in the season, and unfortunately didn't release it in time for a good test group this year.<br /><br />I will continue to work on it over the next few months and hopefully it will be 100% ready for the start of the next football season. I hope to add some cool new features that aren't available anywhere else, and should take the typical game, and bring it to the next level.<br /><br />The game was written in python using the <a href="http://djangoProject.com">Django framework</a>, and <a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a> for a database.<br /><br />Check it out if you have time, and let me know what you think.
