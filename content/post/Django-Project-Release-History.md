I was curious so I went ahead and found out all of the official
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/). releases and when they were
released and how long it took between each release.

There have been 7 major releases and 8 minor releases in the past 5
years. I wonder how this compares to other projects like [Ruby on
Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).
