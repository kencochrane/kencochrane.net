When I was at DjangoCon a few weeks ago, it was great hanging out with
all of the fellow Djangonauts talking about Django and all of other
great technologies. Now that I'm home, I have decided to get off my butt
and do something I should have done a while ago.

Without further ado, I am pleased to announce the creation of
DjangoMaine.com, a new Django user group based in Portland Maine. We
plan on meeting monthly to discuss Django and other python related
technologies. We are currently looking for members, and topic ideas for
future meetings. If you have any ideas or you are interesting in hearing
more, check out our website <http:///www.DjangoMaine.com>
