+++

ActiveState has recently started their own PAAS based on
[CloudFoundry](http://cloudfoundry.org/) this blog post is to help you
get up and running quickly with a Django CMS installation, and hopefully
give you enough information to get your own applications on there as
well.

To keep things simple, I'll just go through the steps that are required
in order to get this up and running and add some comments along the way.
If I missed anything or if you have any questions, please ask in the
comments.

Running on Stackato
===================

1. Register for an account
--------------------------

Go to <http://community.activestate.com/stackato> and register for your
account. They are currently in beta, and you need to be approved before
they will give you access.

2. Install the client
---------------------

There are a few different options, follow the steps outlined here.
<http://docs.stackato.com/quick-start.html#stackato-client-setup>

I tried the option where you download the file, and rename it and put it
in your path. It wasn't complicated, but it wasn't clean either. I chose
this option because I didn't want to install
[pypm](http://code.activestate.com/pypm/), so I'm not sure if that way
is easier or not.

3. Register your client to the cloud
------------------------------------

Now that you have the client installed you need to tell it which cloud
to deploy too. With Stackato, you can run your own local cloud as well
as using the sandbox that ActiveState provided. To make things simple,
I'm going to use the sandbox. If you want to use the local cloud you
will need to [read the
directions](http://docs.stackato.com/quick-start.html#accesssing-the-micro-cloud)
on how to use the local cloud option.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ stackato target api.sandbox.activestate.com
> Successfully targeted to [https://api.sandbox.activestate.com]
```

4. Login to stackato
--------------------

Once you point your client in the correct location, you will need to
login to the cloud. You can find your login information on your
[activestate account page](https://account.activestate.com/). Type the
following and answer the questions when prompted.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ stackato login
> Successfully logged into [https://api.sandbox.activestate.com]
```

5. Download this github repo
----------------------------

To make things easier, I have made a simple django project that has all
of the configuration information setup so that you don't need to do
anything if you want to use djangoCMS. Look at my [github
repo](https://github.com/kencochrane/django-cms-stackato), and see how I
did things if you want to get your own application up and running. If
you want to use djangoCMS, then all you have to do is follow these
steps.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ cd ~/projects
$ git clone git://github.com/kencochrane/django-cms-stackato.git
$ cd django-cms-stackato
```

6. Deploy the project to stackato
---------------------------------

Once you have your application ready, you can push the application to
the cloud. When you do this it will prompt you for a bunch of questions,
answer them and keep track of what you picked for a website url, because
you will need that later. My application is called myblog, but you can
put whatever you want, just change myblog with your name.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ stackato push myblog
```

7. Initialize the database (optional)
-------------------------------------

I have set this up so that it should happen automatically at deployment
see the stackato.yml file for more details. If you want to run the
commands outside of deployments this is what you can do.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ stackato run myblog python mycms/manage.py syncdb --noinput
```

8. Run south migrations (optional)
----------------------------------

I have set this up so that it should happen automatically at deployment
see the stackato.yml file for more details. If you want to run the
commands outside of deployments this is what you can do. It is important
to note *I had to run more then once since it was killed the first time.
Maybe it took too long?*.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ stackato run myblog python mycms/manage.py migrate --noinput
```

9. Collect the static files (optional)
--------------------------------------

I have set this up so that it should happen automatically at deployment
see the stackato.yml file for more details. If you want to run the
commands outside of deployments this is what you can do.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ stackato run myblog python mycms/manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

10. Create the django admin account
-----------------------------------

Now that you have your application installed and you have your database
setup, you need to create the django admin, you can do that with ths
django management command. Make sure you replace the variables with your
values.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ stackato run myblog python mycms/manage.py createsuperuser --username=admin --email=admin@example.com --noinput
```

11. Change the password for the admin user
------------------------------------------

You need to set a password for the admin account so that you can login.
Pick a more secure password then the example I have here. *(notice it is
changepassword2 not changepassword)*

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ stackato run myblog python mycms/manage.py changepassword2 admin secret123P@ssw0rd!
```

12. Open up the url in your browser
-----------------------------------

When you open up the URL that you picked when you deployed in your
browser you should find the DjangoCMS pony welcome page. If not, try
debugging using some of the tips below.

Conclusion
==========

That is it, I did all the hard work, so you should be able to follow
those simple steps and get djangoCMS up and running in no time. Once you
get that working, play around with it, and let me know what you think.
Have you tried the other PAAS options yet, if not check those out as
well, and then let me know which ones you like better and why. I have
written blog posts about most of them at this point, so feel free to
check those out (links below), and have fun playing around.
