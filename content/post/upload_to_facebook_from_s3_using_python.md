+++

If you have some video files stored in Amazon S3 and you want to upload
those videos to a Facebook page, using their video API here is some
python code that I used recently.

I spent a good chunk of a day trying to get this too work, so I'm
posting this here to help anyone else who is trying to do the same.

This code isn't using any special facebook libraries it is just using
normal python along with the requests library. It should be a good
enough example to figure out how to do most things.

It is important to note that you will need a valid access token with
correct permissions in order to get this to work, and that isn't covered
in this blog post.

Another thing that is important to note, that this uses a different API
host then the rest of the facebook API. Instead of `graph.facebook.com`
it uses `graph-video.facebook.com`
