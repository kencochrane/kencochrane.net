I was looking at the pycon US 2012 website when I stumbled upon the huge
list of [sponsors](https://us.pycon.org/2012/sponsors/), which is really
impressive. It got me thinking. Are all of these companies using python?
If so, which ones are the best companies to work for?

If it was up to you, and location and money wasn't a factor, what
company would you work for and why? If you already work at one of these
companies, can you share what it is you use python for, and what it is
like working there?

Here is a list of companies that use Python, in no particular order
(most of these are pycon US 2012 sponsors). If I missed a company,
please let me know.
