+++

Do you want to use Django-cms on dotcloud but don't know where to start?
All you need to do is follow these 12 easy steps, they will get you on
your way.

1.  Create a place to store your project

    > \$ mkdir -p \~/projects

2.  Go into the projects directory

    > \$ cd \~/projects

3.  Clone git repo from github, requires git client.

    > \$ git clone
    > <git://github.com/kencochrane/django-cms-dotcloud.git>

4.  Go into the new project directory

    > \$ cd django-cms-dotcloud

5.  Creating the virtualenv (using virtualenvwrapper, virtualenv,
    and pip)

    > \$ mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute
    > django-cms-dotcloud

6.  Installing the dotCloud client
    <http://docs.dotcloud.com/firststeps/install/> (here are the steps
    for Linux and Mac OSX)

    > \$ sudo pip install -U dotcloud

7.  Sign up for a dotcloud account
    <https://www.dotcloud.com/accounts/register/> if you
    haven't already.
8.  The first time you use the dotcloud account you will need to add
    your api key. So type dotcloud and follow the steps. You can find
    your API key at <http://www.dotcloud.com/account/settings>

    > \$ dotcloud

9.  Create your dotcloud application

    > \$ dotcloud create mycmsapp

10. Push your code into dotcloud

    > \$ dotcloud push mycmsapp .

11. Find out your application url.

    > \$ dotcloud url mycmsapp

12. Open url in your browser and start using djangoCMS on dotcloud.
13. Optional: If you don't like the URL they gave you, you can use your
    custom domain. Assuming your application was ramen.www and your
    domain was www.example.com you would do the following.

    > \$ dotcloud alias add ramen.www www.example.com

Once you get comfortable with how things work, you could add more
plug-ins, create your own custom templates and then change your DEBUG
setting to False. So go ahead [fork my project on
github](https://github.com/kencochrane/django-cms-dotcloud/fork) and get
started.

After you make changes to your local project directory, you can test it
on the server by running the dotcloud push command again.
