I recently gave a talk at a [DjangoMaine](http://www.DjangoMaine.com)
meetup introducing folks to [Python](http://python.org) and
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com). There wasn't enough time to go
over everything, so I tried to pick and choose the parts that I felt
where important to go over, in order to have a good overview of what
Python and Django is all about.

I hope this was useful to the folks that attended. If so, it would be
really helpful to know what parts you would like to know more about.
Then we can have some follow up talks doing a deeper dive into those
select topics.

Future Tutorials
================

Also, if there is a demand, I'm willing to do a half or whole day Python
and Django tutorial, where we would be able to take the time needed to
go into all the different topics, so that you would have a good
understanding of each one, when you left. Ideally I would probably break
up the sessions into beginner, intermediate, and advanced so that people
can move to the different levels as they get more familiar and
comfortable with Django.

I would also like to offer a talk to local high schools. If we have
enough kids that are interested, I'd be willing to go to your high
school and give a talk and introduce these topics to the kids.

If you are interested in learning more about Django, please let me know.
I don't want to waste my time doing all the work preparing for a
tutorial, if there isn't enough demand.

We didn't record the talk, but you can find my slides below.
