New Relic recently added support for python to their awesome web
application performance tool, and I have been playing with it on a
number of projects.

Installing and configuring new relic is pretty well covered in their own
[documentation](http://newrelic.com/docs/python/), so there is no reason
for me to repeat that here. One thing that isn't covered in the
documentation is how to use new relic if you are using supervisord to
control your gunicorn processes, and I'll take this time right now to
show you what I did.

Setting up new relic with supervisord and gunicorn is pretty easy. All
that you need to do, is change your supervisor.conf file and then update
your supevisor config, and you are good to go.

Here is the supervisor.conf file for my awesome app, before I installed
new relic.

*Note: These are not my real conf files, they have been changed to
protect the guilty, so please excuse any typos.*

``` {.sourceCode .txt}
[program:awesome_app]
directory=/opt/apps/awesome_home/awesome_app/
command=/opt/apps/awesome_home/bin/python2.6 /opt/apps/awesome_home/bin/gunicorn_django -c /opt/apps/awesome_home/awesome_app/conf/gunicorn.conf
user=aweman
autostart=true
autorestart=true
environment=HOME='/opt/apps/awesome_home/awesome_app/',DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE='settings'
```

After I installed new relic. All you need to do is add the
'newrelic-admin run-program' command before the 'gunicorn\_django'
command and add an ENV variable called NEW\_RELIC\_CONFIG\_FILE that is
pointing to your newrelic.ini file.

``` {.sourceCode .txt}
[program:awesome_app]
directory=/opt/apps/awesome_home/awesome_app/
command=/opt/apps/awesome_home/bin/newrelic-admin run-program /opt/apps/awesome_home/bin/gunicorn_django -c /opt/apps/awesome_home/awesome_app/conf/gunicorn.conf
user=aweman
autostart=true
autorestart=true
environment=HOME='/opt/apps/awesome_home/awesome_app/',DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE='settings',NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=/opt/apps/awesome_home/awesome_app/conf/newrelic.ini
```

Now that you have the new configuration setup, you will need to let
supervisord know that you have changed t he configuration for that app.
If you run the update command it will prompt supervisord to reread the
configuration file for that app, and reload the config, and then restart
the application with the new configuration.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ supervisorctl update
```

Another thing that is important to note here, is the fact that New Relic
currently doesn't work well with Gunicorn in gevent mode. If you try to
use gevent with gunicorn and new relic, it may not start up at all, or
just not work as it should. Here is what they say in the [Known
Issues](http://newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent) section
of their docs.

> Gunicorn gevent mode - When using gevent mode of gunicorn and the

Because of this, I have changed my gunicorn's to use eventlet when using
new relic, and that seems to work fine. I normally prefer to use gevent,
so hopefully they will be able to fix the issue with gevent so I can
revert back to that setup.

All and all I have been pretty happy with new relic, it has helped us
find issues with our code that would have been a pain otherwise. There
support has been awesome, and they have been adding new fixes/
improvements all the time. Can't wait to see what else they have in
store for the future. I would try it out if you can, they have a lite
version that is free which even includes server monitoring.
