I have finished with my latest iPhone application and I have submitted it to Apple. I submitted it on Sunday 01/17/2010, and hopefully it will be approved by the end of the month. Normally it takes about 10-14 days for apple to approve apps but there have been recent reports that apps have been approved in as little as 2-3 days. I'll keep my fingers crossed and post when I hear back.<br /><br />Face Flip is a simple iPhone application that allows you to take your photos and mix and match them with other photos to make crazy faces. You can add photos to the app using the built in iPhone Camera or it will take photos from the iPhone photo album. Once the photos are in the app you can switch to mixer mode and the app will slice the photos into 3 separate parts, Top, middle and bottom. On the mixer mode it will allow you to swipe the different parts, left or right, until you get to a cool combo. Once you find the perfect Face Flip photo you can export the photos from the app, you can either email them to your friends, or save it to iPhone photo album, or both.<br /><br />The app was built to be very simple, and easy to use, and most of all FUN.<br /><br />If you get a chance, go ahead and download it, and let me know what you think.<br /><br />Here are some screen shots.<img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zHa3HAIVnnA/S1R6k-0xzgI/AAAAAAAABdo/T_k5eRpvFJY/s320/screenshot5.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5428098226646535682" border="0" /><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zHa3HAIVnnA/S1R6eB3yEfI/AAAAAAAABdg/6s7Ixc_SGIc/s320/screenshot4.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5428098107205358066" border="0" /><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zHa3HAIVnnA/S1R6d-pZQTI/AAAAAAAABdY/znQdQ7gr_YM/s320/screenshot3.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5428098106339705138" border="0" /><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zHa3HAIVnnA/S1R6dgbftfI/AAAAAAAABdQ/azYJFeuWcvs/s320/screenshot2.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5428098098228344306" border="0" /><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zHa3HAIVnnA/S1R6dWiEvsI/AAAAAAAABdI/2w0ZUBfkEVw/s320/screenshot1.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5428098095571582658" border="0" /><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zHa3HAIVnnA/S1R6dNyJ0SI/AAAAAAAABdA/YU3-k88iHvA/s320/faceflipsplash.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5428098093223104802" border="0" />
