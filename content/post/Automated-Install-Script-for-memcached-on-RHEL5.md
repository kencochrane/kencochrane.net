I created this script that will download memcached build,install and set
it up to start up automatically on reboot. It also installs the init.d
script to manage memcache so you can restart etc.

You can either copy and paste it into your shell prompt using a user
that has install privileges (root,admin,etc) or you can copy into a .sh
file and execute it.

The code for most of this was take from this blog post:
<http://www.vbseo.com/blogs/danny-bembibre/daemon-scripts-memcached-44/>
it doesn't seem to be around anymore so I put it here for anyone else
looking for this very helpful info.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
wget http://memcached.googlecode.com/files/memcached-1.4.5.tar.gz
tar -xvzf memcached-1.4.5.tar.gz
cd memcached-1.4.5
./configure
make
make test
make install
