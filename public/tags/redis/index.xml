&lt;p&gt;Normally websites do very few logins, someone logs in once and their
session is good for a bunch of hours. Since it&amp;rsquo;s a one time thing, it
doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if it isn&amp;rsquo;t very fast. At
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; our authentication system handles
requests for both the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.docker.com&#34;&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt;, as well as
all Docker Engine commands that interact with the Docker Hub (docker
push, pull, etc). This Authentication system handles thousands of login
attempts every minute, so any slow down in the login process has a large
impact on our system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are always looking at ways to improve the security of our systems,
and one of the things we looked at implementing was a way to prevent
brute force login attempts. The first thing we did was look to see if
there was an open source solution available that would do what we
needed. The Docker Hub along with the authentication system is written
in Python using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.djangoproject.com&#34;&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; . So we did some
research to see what was the best solution available to us. We quickly
came to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/django-pci/django-axes&#34;&gt;django-axes&lt;/a&gt;, which
is a great library, and had everything we were looking for. Best of all,
it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that hard to add to our system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we started using django-axes our traffic was pretty normal, but
with the explosive growth of Docker we have seen a huge increases in
traffic. As the traffic increased, we started noticing that login times
were slowing down. Upon further inspection we noticed that with
django-axes turned on it was adding a 200 to 300ms overheard compared to
when it was turned off. We did some more digging to see what was causing
all of the delay, and we found out the reason is because django-axes
stores all of its information in the database and in order to determine
if someone is blocked you need to do a bunch of queries, and the more
login attempts, the larger the axes database tables get, and thus the
queries get slower, and in turn slows down the login process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first attempts to speed things up was to add more database indexes,
and to run a script that kept the axes database tables small. This
worked for a little while, but as the traffic increased, it stopped
working. It was quickly determined that we would need to replace
django-axes. We looked around at other brute force libraries, and there
was nothing that offered what we needed for features, was fast, and well
maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything, I started working on a replacement. On
one of my many cross country flights, I started working on a
replacement. In order to make the process quicker, it started as a fork
of django-axes, where I removed the stuff we didn&amp;rsquo;t need, and then
replaced the slow parts with faster ones. The main goal was to avoid
hitting the database in order to determine if the user was blocked.
Since we are big fans of &lt;a href=&#34;http://redis.io&#34;&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt;, and we were using it
in other places already, we decided to use Redis as our backend for
storing all of our data for determining if someone is blocked. We also
allow the logging of login attempts to the database, but to speed things
up, we defer this to a background celery task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few cross country flights, and some help from some of my
co-workers, we now have a library, that we are using on the Docker Hub.
We have been using it for about a month now, and the results have been
great. With this new library we are seeing under a 10ms impact on our
logins, which is really great. We are able to have the features we need
without the overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have proven the project to be successful, we have decided to
open source the library, so that others can also use it, and contribute
back any features or improvements they might find important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, I&amp;rsquo;m proud to introduce &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kencochrane/django-defender&#34;&gt;Django
Defender&lt;/a&gt;, a brute force
login preventions library built for speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have labeled the first version 0.1, but it is very stable and already
production ready. We have very good code coverage (95%+) and we have
tests and support for a number of different Python and Django versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have django admin pages that can be used to manage the blocked
users and IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please try it out, and let us know if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
