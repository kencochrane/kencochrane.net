&lt;h1 id=&#34;updates:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;Updates&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated 2/16/2012: Full disclosure. On Feb 16th 2012, I accepted a
job with dotCloud. I plan on keeping this blog post up to date
and impartial. If you think there are any errors, please let me know
in the comments below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated 1/26/2012: Updated Gondor.io with info from Donald Stufft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated 01/24/2012: changed gondor.io to include SSL support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated 01/01/2012: Added Heroku and updated ep.io, gondor.io,
and dotcloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;intro:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past 6 weeks I have been trying out all of the new django/python
hosting services that are currently available today, and I have been
writing about my experiences along the way. It only makes sense to
conclude this series of articles with one last article comparing all of
the services against each other. It is important to note that many of
these services are still in development and aren&amp;rsquo;t even available to the
general public, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep this article up to date as these
services change over time. With that said, don&amp;rsquo;t take my word for it, go
out and try all of these services on your own and find out which one you
like the best, you won&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;quick-recap:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;Quick Recap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ep-io:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;ep.io&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog post: &lt;a href=&#34;http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/04/my-experiences-with-epio/&#34;&gt;My Experiences with
ep.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty solid offering, with a nice set of features and a decent price.
Good set of documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Epio closed down on May 31st 2012 ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gondor-io:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;gondor.io&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog post: &lt;a href=&#34;http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/04/my-day-gondorio/&#34;&gt;My day in
gondor.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their website has a nice list of features that they expect to have once
they officially launch, but most of those features aren&amp;rsquo;t available yet.
The documentation is a little light, but the service has a lot of
potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dotcloud-com:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;dotCloud.com&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog post: &lt;a href=&#34;http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/04/deploying-my-django-application-to-dotcloud/&#34;&gt;Deploying my Django application to
dotcloud.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a ton of money ($10M), and with it, a ton of features. They
are very developer friendly, but you need to be pretty technical, it
isn&amp;rsquo;t quite ready for beginners. Good set of documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Full disclosure&lt;/strong&gt;: I now work for dotCloud]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;apphosted-com:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;AppHosted.com&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog post: &lt;a href=&#34;http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/05/apphosted-com-django-hosting-review/&#34;&gt;apphosted.com Django Hosting
Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built with security, stability and scalability on their mind from the
beginning. They have a solid offering, and they look to be targeting
enterprise customers who will pay more for that peace of mind. They are
currently lacking some key features, which I&amp;rsquo;m sure they will be adding
soon. Good set of documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;djangozoom-com:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;DjangoZoom.com&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog post: &lt;a href=&#34;http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/06/djangozoom-com-review/&#34;&gt;DjangoZoom.com
Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built to be fast and easy to use, still missing some key features, but
I&amp;rsquo;m sure they will be available by the time they go live. Decent amount
of documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;heroku-com:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;Heroku.com&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog post: &lt;a href=&#34;http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/11/developers-guide-for-running-django-apps-on-heroku/&#34;&gt;Developers guide for running django apps on
Heroku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally built as a Ruby on Rails service, they have now added support
for python. The service is still in beta, but it has a lot of potential.
It looks a lot like what dotCloud is offering, with the ability to run
code from almost any language, and a ton of different add-ons for lots
of different services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;awards:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;Awards&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fastest-deployments:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;Fastest Deployments:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://DjangoZoom.com&#34;&gt;DjangoZoom.com&lt;/a&gt; - Zoom is right, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take
long to configure your application and have it up and running on their
servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;easiest-to-use:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;Easiest To Use:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://DjangoZoom.com&#34;&gt;DjangoZoom.com&lt;/a&gt; - No command line interface
needed, just a web browser, a project in a git repo that it has access
too, and a few questions answered and your app is up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;most-features:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;Most Features:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dotcloud.com&#34;&gt;dotCloud.com&lt;/a&gt; - They raised \$10 Million, and they
are spending it on hiring people, buying companies, and building
services. They have a bunch of services currently and they don&amp;rsquo;t plan on
stopping, their roadmap has everything on it, and I think if you give
them enough time they will eventually have a service for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;most-developer-friendly:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;Most Developer Friendly:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dotcloud.com&#34;&gt;dotCloud.com&lt;/a&gt; - They give lots of features without
handcuffing the developer. They are the only company with full database
and shell access. They do a good job of offering the same type of
service a developer could get if they built it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;best-overall-value:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;Best Overall Value:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ep.io&#34;&gt;ep.io&lt;/a&gt; - This one is hard since most of the services
don&amp;rsquo;t have any pricing listed, but currently ep.io is in the lead, they
offer reasonable prices with a nice Free tier. This allows developers to
try out the service for FREE, as well as run smaller pet projects that
they might not have tried before because they didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for
hosting. They have the second most features available, second to only
dotCloud, and there service is pretty solid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;easiest-project-setup:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;Easiest Project Setup:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://apphosted.com&#34;&gt;apphosted.com&lt;/a&gt; - Their goal was to make it real
easy to get your project up onto their servers without having to change
your project, and they did that, there was very little if any changes I
needed to make in order to get my application up on their servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;django-feature-hosting-matrix:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;Django Feature Hosting Matrix&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make things easier when comparing all of the different services I
have built this matrix with all of the information I compiled from each
of the services. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the answers for all services, but I&amp;rsquo;ll
update it when I find out those answers. If you know the answers feel
free to post a comment to let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have included all of the new django services as well as google app
engine and webfaction.com, a tradition hosting service. This should make
it a little easier to see how these new services compare to other
hosting options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Chart removed since it was out of date]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;who-wins:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;Who wins?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is really hard to pick just one winner, mainly because most of these
services are still in beta and not quite finished yet. Also because each
service is a little different, and it will depend on what you are trying
to do. So, go out try them out, and let me know which one you picked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real winner is us, the developers, and the python community in
general. We now have a bunch of really cool services that will make our
lives better, and that is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;thank-you:bcec1efcbef3921a30bfadad97f88500&#34;&gt;Thank you!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to thank all of the people who made these services, and gave me
early access to their systems so that I could play around with them. I
wish them the best of luck, and hope they all are really successful, and
they are around for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This is part five in my series on django hosting services. Previously, I
looked at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/04/my-experiences-with-epio/&#34;&gt;ep.io&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/05/apphosted-com-django-hosting-review/&#34;&gt;apphosted.com&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/04/my-day-gondorio/&#34;&gt;gondor.io&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/04/deploying-my-django-application-to-dotcloud/&#34;&gt;dotcloud.com&lt;/a&gt;
and now I&amp;rsquo;m looking at &lt;a href=&#34;http://DjangoZoom.com&#34;&gt;DjangoZoom.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DjangoZoom.com is the brain child of Nate Aune and Shimon Rura and is
based in Boston, Massachusetts. It was founded in 2010 at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://startupweekend.org/&#34;&gt;StartupWeekend Boston&lt;/a&gt; and was a finalist
in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.masschallenge.org/&#34;&gt;MassChallenge&lt;/a&gt;. Their office is
in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dogpatchlabs.com/&#34;&gt;Dogpatch Labs&lt;/a&gt; space for startups in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. They are currently still in a closed beta, but
they were nice enough to send me an invite to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally when I check out a service for the first time, I look over the
documentation to see what it can do, and what it can&amp;rsquo;t do, and what I
need to do in order to get my app up and running. DjangoZoom has a nice
collection of documents that help guide you through the process of
getting your application up and running on their platform. You need to
be logged in, in order to read the documents, so I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to link
to any documents here, but if you are lucky enough to get an invite to
DjangoZoom, I would check out the documents first, they will make the
process much easier. They answer most of the common questions that you
will have, and if you can&amp;rsquo;t find your answer you can send them a message
and they are very fast to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading the documents I learned a few things. First off,
DjangoZoom is a little different then the other services, all of the
previous services that I have reviewed ep.io, dotcloud, apphosted,
gondor.io, had a command line client that you use to push your
application up onto their servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DjangoZoom doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a command line client at all, they only have a
web based control panel that you use to install and configure your
application. Also, instead of pushing your application code up on to
their servers, they pull the code down from your code repository at
build time. Most of the other services try and make it so that you can
run any python/wsgi based application, where as DjangoZoom, is only
supporting Django applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not having a command line client has it&amp;rsquo;s pros and cons. The main
advantage of not having a command line client is simplicity. No need to
install anything on your machine in order to deploy your code, all you
need is a web browser. You can deploy your code from anywhere you have
an internet connection. Making the application deployment as easy as
possible will open up their service to people that are less technical,
and might not be comfortable installing a command line client and
running commands. The disadvantages of using just a web based console is
that you are limited to what you can do in a browser. This is going to
be less and less of an issue going forward as web browsers are getting
more and more powerful all of the time. Also, just because they only
offer a web based console now, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they can&amp;rsquo;t add a command
line client later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like all of the other reviews I&amp;rsquo;m going to test out the system by
deploying my blog onto their system and see how it goes. My blog is
currently hosted on bitbucket.org which uses mercurial, and currently
djangozoom.com only offers support for git. In order to use
djangozoom.com I needed to make a fork of my blog and put it on github.
You can find my fork here:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kencochrane/kencochrane_blog&#34;&gt;https://github.com/kencochrane/kencochrane_blog&lt;/a&gt; . They recommend
github for git hosting, but you can use just about any git repo that is
publicly accessible. If you have a private git repo, and you are on
github just add the user djangozoom as a collaborator on your project.
If you aren&amp;rsquo;t on github and you have a private repo, you can add their
public key to your repo, and it will give them permission to access your
git repository from their servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;install-process:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;Install Process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had my code up on github I needed to make a few changes in order
for it to work correctly, nothing major just needed to make my
settings.py file a little more standard, which was pretty typical for
the other services as well. Now that I had that done, I was ready to
login to DjangoZoom and setup my application. Registering and logging
into DjangoZoom was pretty straight forward, it was the same process as
most online services, so just about anyone could do it with their eyes
closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I logged in, I was able to add my application, here are the steps
that I took to get my application up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicked on &amp;ldquo;add a new project&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put in repo url: &lt;a href=&#34;git://github.com/kencochrane/kencochrane_blog.git&#34;&gt;git://github.com/kencochrane/kencochrane_blog.git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Only SSH authentication is supported, so use either an
unauthenticated public URL, or an SSH url (e.g.
&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:git@github.com&#34;&gt;git@github.com&lt;/a&gt;:yourname/project.git. On github.org, use the Git
Read-Only URL if your repo is public, or the SSH URL if private.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit Next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entered my title &amp;ldquo;kencochrane_blog&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;selected django 1.3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;settings module : mysite.settings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;static media location : &amp;ldquo;static /site-media&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;no additional directories to add to python path&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;put in my requirements.txt file, so that it knows where to find my pip
requirements. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to do this, djangozoom will scan your
projects and find this out for you, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me, I have
an issue with my application that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find, and it was
causing issues with their autoscanner. I think this is more my fault
then theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not putting in any extra requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;base(repo) python package: put mysite.settings because my settings.py
and root urls.py are at the top level of your repository. normally I
don&amp;rsquo;t do this, but I was following the example of this repo
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/natea/mezzanine-site&#34;&gt;https://github.com/natea/mezzanine-site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checked the &amp;ldquo;ready to roll, deploy my project now&amp;rdquo; check box and hit
next&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I had some errors with my requirements, I needed to remove
django and mysql and update the python-twitter lib. Once I did that, it
worked like a charm. The whole deploy process only took 2 minutes and 45
seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow that was fast, pretty impressive considering it needed to pull down
all of the code from github, and download a ton of dependencies, and
then do what ever it needs to do to set it up on to their servers. After
talking with them about this, they said they hope to get it even faster,
which would be pretty impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have my app deployed I can change some of the settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created an alias to for my app to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://kencochrane.djangozoom.net&#34;&gt;http://kencochrane.djangozoom.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also add a hostname like kencochrane.net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can add a wildcard hostname as well. *.kencochrane.net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create a django superuser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also run any of your manage.py commands right from the web
console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole process was pretty straight forward and didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to
complete. Now that I have done it with one application, it will be much
easier for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cool-feature-request:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;Cool Feature Request&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently DjangoZoom makes it really easy to deploy your application to
their servers. What would be cool is if they would make it easy to
deploy common django applications to their service. For example on their
blog they have a video to show how easy it is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://djangozoom.com/blog/2011/03/15/deploying-django-cms-45-seconds-djangozoom/&#34;&gt;deploy django-cms to
DjangoZoom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the video it shows them going out to github, forking and copying the
link to the project, and then making some minor changes on the
djangozoom settings page to get it to work correctly, and then it
deploys. These steps weren&amp;rsquo;t complicated but you needed to know what to
do in order to get it to work. What if they made this a one step
process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on a &amp;ldquo;install django-cms&amp;rdquo; link, and then their service would do
what it needs to do to get it up and running on their service, and then
returns you to a page where you can configure the app, add a django
admin user, change the url, etc. That would allow someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t
know anything about django an easy way to get a django-cms based website
in no time. They could add one click installs for all kinds of common
django projects, and expand outside of the developer community, which
would expand their customer base. Those customers are the ones that
really don&amp;rsquo;t want to worry about server deploys and server management,
and they are the ones that will pay more for those features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure this feature isn&amp;rsquo;t on their roadmap, but I just thought I would
throw it out there and see what people have to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;djangozoom-com-status:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;DjangoZoom.com status&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DjangoZoom is still in closed beta, which means they are not done with
it yet, and there may be some occasional bugs that pop up here and
there, but that is expected. Another thing about a beta is that not all
of the features are finished yet. So before you jump in and try and get
your application up and running, check and make sure that your
application can run correctly on the service with the features they have
available so far. Here is a run down of all the different features your
application might need and where they stand in DjangoZoom today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;logging:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;Logging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You currently can&amp;rsquo;t view your django or nginx logs at this time, they
are working on this feature and hope to have it so that you can view
your logs in the web based console in the future. In the meantime you
can use a tool like django-sentry to view your django-logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ssl:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;SSL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not available yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;caching:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;Caching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They currently don&amp;rsquo;t support a caching server, they want to make sure
they set it up correctly so that it is reliable and so that it is
secure. In the meantime you can use django local memory caching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;database:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;Database&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They support PostgreSQL 8.4, if you are using mysql you will need to
convert your app to support PostgreSQL. Since the Django ORM handles
this by default, this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a big deal unless you did something
custom. No direct database access available. Loading data into system
only supported by using django dumpdata/loaddata&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-tasks:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;Background tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not available yet, celery support possible in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cronjobs:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;Cronjobs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not supported, they recommend &lt;a href=&#34;http://packages.python.org/APScheduler/&#34;&gt;Advanced Python
Scheduler&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reavis/django-cron&#34;&gt;django-cron&lt;/a&gt; which should run on
their system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shell-access:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;Shell Access&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not supported&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;api:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not available yet, one planned for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;command-line-client:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;Command line client&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not available yet, one planned for the future. Use the web base control
panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;version-control:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;Version control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently only supports git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some videos of the DjangoZoom.com deployment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed playing with DjangoZoom, it is quick and easy to use,
it is still missing some key features that some people will need, but
I&amp;rsquo;m sure they will add those soon enough. I wish them luck, and I can&amp;rsquo;t
wait to see them go live to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;update:927af003b7c8858a42469bacd2525b8a&#34;&gt;Update:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read how this service stacks up against other services like it in my
&lt;a href=&#34;http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/06/django-hosting-roundup-who-wins/&#34;&gt;Django hosting
roundup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/16/2012: Full disclosure. On Feb 16th 2012, I accepted a job with
dotCloud a competitor to DjangoZoom. I plan on keeping this blog post up
to date and impartial. If you think there are any errors, please let me
know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
